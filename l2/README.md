### Weekly Insights

- Week 1:
  - I realized prompting is more of a skill than just writing questions — small changes in clarity, structure, and examples drastically change the quality of answers.
  - Explanation of training made me view LLMs less as “magic black boxes” and more as operating systems with different phases and security layers.
  - Understanding that hallucinations aren’t just “mistakes,” but come from gaps in grounding, made me see why adding structure, step-by-step reasoning is essential.
  - Seeing how LLMs handle tokens, context windows, and external tools gave me a mental model for when the model alone is enough and when I should extend it.
  - The better we learn how something works, the better we will use it.
