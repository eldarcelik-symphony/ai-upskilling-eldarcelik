# Project Memory

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Books Library
- **Purpose**: Next.js application for managing a digital books library
- **Start Date**: September 2025
- **Type**: Capstone project for AI upskilling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (based on components.json)
- **Build Tool**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom email verification
- **Form Validation**: Zod with react-hook-form
- **Email Service**: Resend (for custom email templates)

## Architecture Decisions

- Using Next.js App Router (app/ directory structure)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling with component-based approach
- shadcn/ui for consistent UI components
- ESLint for code quality
- Server Actions for form handling (signup/login)
- Database triggers for automatic user profile creation
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies for data protection

## Coding Standards

- Follow [coding_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/coding_rules.mdc) for general development practices
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Component-based architecture with composition
- Early returns and guard clauses for readability
- Meaningful variable and function names
- JSDoc comments for functions and components

## Requirements

Based on [PRD.txt](mdc:scripts/PRD.txt), the project implements a Book Rental Library with:

### Core Features

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**: Email/password signup with email verification, role-based access (USER/ADMIN)
2. **User Management (Admin)**: Admin dashboard for user approval workflow (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED)
3. **Book Management (Admin)**: Full CRUD operations with cover image upload, search, pagination
4. **Book Catalog & Borrowing (User)**: Public catalog with search, book details, borrowing system
5. **Dashboards & Profiles**: Admin dashboards, user profiles, book return functionality

### Technical Requirements

- Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Supabase for database, auth, and file storage
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Resend for email notifications
- Role-based route protection

## API Endpoints

### Server Actions (lib/actions/)

- **auth.actions.ts**: `logoutUser()` - User logout with redirect
- **book.actions.ts**: Complete book management operations
  - `getAllBooks()` - Paginated book listing with search/sort/filter
  - `getCatalogBooks()` - Get all books for catalog
  - `createBook()` - Create new book with cover image upload
  - `updateBook()` - Update book with smart availability calculation
  - `disableBook()` - Soft delete (set is_active = false)
  - `deleteBook()` - Hard delete (only when no borrowed copies)

### Authentication Endpoints

- **app/login/actions.ts**: `signInAction()` - User login with validation
- **app/signup/actions.ts**: `signUpAction()` - User registration with email verification

## Database Schema

### Tables

- **auth.users** (Supabase managed) - Core authentication data
- **users** (public schema) - User information including role and approval status (id, email, role, approval_status, created_at, updated_at)
- **books** - Book catalog with availability tracking (id, title, author, isbn, category, total_copies, available_copies, is_active, timestamps)
- **borrowed_books** - Book borrowing records (id, book_id, user_id, borrowed_at, returned_at, due_date, timestamps)

### Key Features

- **Automatic Functions & Triggers**:
  - User auto-creation when signing up via Supabase Auth
  - Book availability tracking (available_copies automatically updated)
  - Timestamp management (created_at/updated_at maintained automatically)
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Indexes on frequently queried fields (email, role, ISBN, category, due dates)
- **Security (RLS Policies)**:
  - Users can manage their own data and view all users
  - Books have public read access, authenticated users can manage
  - Borrowed books restricted to user's own records
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
  - Unique constraints preventing duplicate borrowings
  - Check constraints for data validation
- **Role-based access control** (USER/ADMIN roles)
- **User approval workflow** (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED)
