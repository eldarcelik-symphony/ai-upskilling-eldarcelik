# Task ID: 10
# Title: UI/UX Refinement and End-to-End Testing
# Status: To Do
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Polish the user interface for a clean, responsive design and conduct end-to-end testing of all key user flows.
# Details:
Review all pages for consistent styling, responsiveness, and accessibility using Shadcn and Tailwind CSS. Manually test the three key user flows: New User Registration, Book Borrowing, and Admin Book Management from start to finish to catch any integration issues.

# Test Strategy:
Perform manual testing on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Execute the key user flows without errors. Check the browser console for any warnings or errors. Ensure the final application feels polished and intuitive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Standardize Global UI Components and Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and refine the main application layout, header, navigation, and footer. Ensure consistent use of typography, spacing, and color schemes as defined by the Tailwind CSS configuration. Standardize the look and feel of core shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input) used across the application.
### Details:
Examine `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`, `src/components/header.tsx`, and `src/app/layout.tsx`. Check for consistent branding and navigation across all pages. Ensure the main layout is responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. Create a consistent responsive behavior for the main navigation menu.

## 2. Refine UI/UX for Public and User-Facing Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Polish the UI for all public-facing pages, including the book catalog, book detail pages, and the authenticated user's 'My Books' dashboard. Focus on readability, intuitive navigation, and responsive design.
### Details:
Review `src/app/(main)/books/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/books/[bookId]/page.tsx`, and `src/app/(main)/my-books/page.tsx`. Ensure the book catalog's grid layout (`src/components/book-card.tsx`) adapts gracefully to smaller screens. Check that the book detail page presents information clearly and the 'Borrow' button is prominent. The 'My Books' table should be responsive.

## 3. Polish Admin Interface for Responsiveness and Usability [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Review and improve the UI/UX of all admin-only pages, including the book management table, add/edit book forms, and the borrowing activity dashboard. Ensure tables and forms are fully functional and easy to use on smaller screens.
### Details:
Focus on `src/app/(main)/admin/books/page.tsx`, `src/components/books-table.tsx`, `src/components/book-form.tsx`, and `src/app/(main)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`. Implement horizontal scrolling or a card-based layout for tables on mobile. Ensure form fields in `book-form.tsx` are well-spaced and usable on touch devices.

## 4. End-to-End Test: New User Registration and Book Borrowing Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Perform a complete manual end-to-end test of the new user registration and book borrowing user journey. This test simulates the entire lifecycle of a new user wanting to borrow a book.
### Details:
Execute the following steps: 1. Navigate to the signup page and create a new user account. 2. Check for the verification email and click the link. 3. Log in with the new credentials. 4. Browse the book catalog and select a book. 5. From the book detail page, click the 'Borrow' button. 6. Navigate to the 'My Books' page and verify the borrowed book is listed.

## 5. End-to-End Test: Admin Book Management and Dashboard Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Perform a complete manual end-to-end test of the admin book management (CRUD) and dashboard verification flow. This ensures an admin can manage the library catalog and monitor activity.
### Details:
Execute the following steps: 1. Log in as an admin user. 2. Navigate to the admin book management page. 3. Create a new book with a cover image. 4. Verify the new book appears in the list. 5. Edit the details of the newly created book and save. 6. Verify the changes are reflected. 7. Delete the book and confirm its removal. 8. Navigate to the admin dashboard to check borrowing activity.
